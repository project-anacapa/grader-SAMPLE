This is testable1 (or testable2, testable3, etc.) directory.

Under this directory, and each such directory, you should have an `index.json` file.

In that file, you need something like this.   The syntax rules are those for JSON (see: http://json.org )

```json
{
  "makefile_target" : "testcase1",
  "hide_results_from_students" : false
}
```
